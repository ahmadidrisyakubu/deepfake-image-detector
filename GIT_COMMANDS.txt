# Git Commands for Deployment

## If you already pushed to GitHub (fixing the Railway error):

cd deepfake-detector

# Add the fixed runtime.txt
git add runtime.txt RAILWAY_FIX.md

# Commit the fix
git commit -m "Fix: Update Python version for Railway compatibility"

# Push to GitHub (Railway will auto-redeploy)
git push origin main


## If this is your first time pushing to GitHub:

cd deepfake-detector

# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Deepfake detector with Railway fix"

# Set main branch
git branch -M main

# Add your GitHub repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/deepfake-detector.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main


## After pushing:

1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Railway will automatically detect the new commit
3. A new build will start automatically
4. Wait 10-15 minutes for deployment
5. Check the build logs to verify success
6. Test your application at the Railway URL


## Troubleshooting:

If Railway still fails, try removing runtime.txt entirely:
git rm runtime.txt
git commit -m "Remove runtime.txt to use Railway default Python"
git push origin main
